# Chaos Game

#### Idea

_Ordo Ab Chao_, from Latin (roots can also be found in sanskrit), it means "Order From Chaos". This short but powerful quote is present on US bank notes and is also a symbol for freemasons.<br/>
Looking at it's origins this concept is a timeless and cultureless concept that humans have always been exploring and interested in.

#### Project

I'm going to approach this idea in this small project, using math and chaos we will create fractal-like patterns.

Using the C programming language and the [CSFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/) graphical library (I do not recommend using this lib, it's very poorly optimized, I'm a student and this is the lib that we've been introduced to).

#### How it works

Compilation using Makefile: `make`

Execution : `./chaos_game [OPTIONS] [XA YA XB YB XC YC]`

Use `./chaos_game -h` for more information.
